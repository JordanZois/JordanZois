-  Hi, I’m @JordanZois
-  I’m interested in Programming and Mechanical and Materials Engineering
-  I’m currently learning AutoHotkey 
-  This page will serve as a repository for my summer 2022 and onward endevers into programming
-  My current goal is to program an auto-purchasing script in AutoHotkey and successfully purchase a single item from a webpage
